# Homebrew Tap

This tap contains Homebrew casks for John Boiles projects.

## Install

```sh
brew tap johnboiles/homebrew-tap
brew install --cask quicklookstep
```

## Update the cask to a versioned release

If you prefer versioned releases, edit `Casks/quicklookstep.rb` to set a
specific `version` and `sha256`, and update the `url` to the versioned
release asset.
